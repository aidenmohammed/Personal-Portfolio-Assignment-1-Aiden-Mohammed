            <div id = "projectexplanation">
                <p>I created a game that took arrow keys as inputs from the user and moved a pac-man character around on a screen.</p>
                <p>I also created two enemies that would bounce off walls. </p>
                <p>If the player touched an enemy, a game over screen would display and the window would close on it's own.</p>

            <div id = "projectexplanation">
                <p>I was required to recreate multiple sorting algorithms within Java</p>
                <p>These sorting algorithms included: Bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort, and marge sort.</p>

            <div id = "projecttitle"><h3>Cookie Clicker</h3></div>
            <div id = "projectexplanation">
                <p>I created an almost identical copy of the game Cookie Clicker in Java.</p>
                <p>This projects required me to create multiple classes with different methods including getters and setters.</p>
                <p>It also required me to create recursion within methods and generate random numbers.</p>

            <div id = "projectexplanation">
                <p>During first year in University at Ontario Tech, I worked with even more difficult sorting algorims.</p>
                <p>I learned not just how to code different sorting algorithms, but also what steps they would take to sort a list.</p>

            <div id = "projecttitle"><h3>Combining multiple sorting algorithms</h3></div>
            <div id = "projectexplanation">
                <p>For my final project of programming in Year 1 University, I was required to write multiple layers of sorting algorithms</p>
                <p>This included taking inputs from the user, using recursion, and sorting algorithms within sorting algorithms</p>
