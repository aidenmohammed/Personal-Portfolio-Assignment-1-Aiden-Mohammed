            <div id = "projectexplanation">
                <p>I created a game that took arrow keys as inputs from the user and moved a pac-man character around on a screen.</p>
                <p>I also created two enemies that would bounce off walls. </p>
                <p>If the player touched an enemy, a game over screen would display and the window would close on it's own</p>
                <p>This project was completely coded in python 3. All code was written by Aiden Mohammed.</p>

            <div id = "projectexplanation">
                <p>I was required to recreate multiple sorting algorithms within Java</p>
                <p>These sorting algorithms included: Bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort, and marge sort.</p>

            <div id = "projectexplanation">
                <p>I created a game that was very similar to the game Cookie Clicker.</p>
                <p>This projects required me to create multiple classes with different methods including getters and setters.</p>
                <p>It also required me to create recursion within methods and generate random numbers.</p>

            <div id = "projectexplanation">
                <p>During first year in University at Ontario Tech, I worked with more difficult sorting algorims.</p>
                <p>I learned not just how to code different sorting algorithms, but also what steps they would take to sort a list.</p>
